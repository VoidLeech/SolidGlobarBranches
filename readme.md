# Solid Globar Branches - A [snifferent](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/snifferent) addon
Solid Globar Branches does one thing. Make Globar Branches Solid: Collideable, Fun, Better.  
Or that was the plan, and instead there's a bunch of fixes thrown in too.

### Features
- Globar Branches now have a unique 3D model, to reflect the fact that they're now fully collideable. You can walk on them!
- Globar Branches don't float anymore; they require a solid blockface to hang on, or another Globar Branch.
- Falling on Globar Branches causes them to snap and break, be careful! Certain mobs are immune to this, and Feather/Slow Falling mitigates/prevents this.
- Sniffberry Vines are now climbable
- Create Recipe Compat
- JEED Compat
- Globar Branches (in block form) now count as logs for better compat with tree-cutting mods.

### Fixes
- snifferent's potion recipes are now viewable in recipe viewers like JEI.
- The Club Moss Carpet is now visible in 1st person, is placeable, and doesn't allow plants to float a block above it.
- All of snifferent's flower crops can now be planted on modded farmland.
- Amber Block now properly switches to its glowing (light-emitting) variant.
- Most snifferent items are now compostable.
- Globar Branch is now useable as furnace fuel.
- Globar Sap Bottle now has a glass bottle as crafting remainder.
