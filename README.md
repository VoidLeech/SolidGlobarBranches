Solid Globar Branches does one thing. Make Globar Branches Solid: Collideable, Fun, Better.  
Or that was the plan, and instead there's a bunch of fixes thrown in too.

[![Oblivion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VoidLeech/Oblivion/1.20.1/forge/src/main/resources/icon.png)](https://github.com/VoidLeech/Oblivion)  
Requires Oblivion.

### Features
- Globar Branches now have a unique 3D model, to reflect the fact that they're now fully collideable. You can walk on them!
- Globar Branches don't float anymore; they require a solid blockface to hang on, or another Globar Branch.
- Falling on Globar Branches causes them to snap and break, be careful! Certain mobs are immune to this, and Feather/Slow Falling mitigates/prevents this.
- Sniffberry Vines are now climbable.
- Globar Branches (in block form) now count as logs for better compat with tree-cutting mods.
- Porus Globar Logs are now obtainable with Silk Touch, as they are already movable with pistons so there's really no harm making them obtainable.
- Sniffberry vines can now be bone-mealed, which allows them to grow beyond the random max height (you can also break and replant to get a new random max height).
- Sniffberry vines can now be trimmed (with shears) to prevent them from growing.
- Sniffberries can now be harvested via right click.
- Signs & Boats for snifferent Woodtype.
- Create and Create: Vintage Improvements recipe compat.
- JEED compat.
- KleeSlabs compat.
- Seamless compat.

### Fixes
- snifferent's potion recipes are now viewable in recipe viewers like JEI.
- The Club Moss Carpet is now visible in 1st person, is placeable, and doesn't allow plants to float a block above it.
- All of snifferent's flower crops can now be planted on modded farmland.
- Amber Block now properly switches to its glowing (light-emitting) variant.
- Most snifferent items are now compostable.
- Globar Branch is now usable as furnace fuel.
- Globar Sap Bottle now has a glass bottle as crafting remainder.
- Globar Branches on grown trees now always have the correct 'facing' value.
- Amber and Amber Glass are now considered equal to their Glowing variants w.r.t. rendering.
- Porus Globar Logs with Globar Sap in them now have the Porus Globar Log as pick-block item.
- Several right click actions now work in the off-hand.
